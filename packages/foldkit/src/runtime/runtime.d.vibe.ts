     * RPC client rebuilt on every invocation), or when every Command must
     * share one instance (an AudioContext whose oscillators feed one audio

     * startup fails instead. Neither cause is swallowed, so a Flags Effect
     * that fails for its own unrelated reason stays visible alongside the
     * build error.
     *
     * Provide a service inside the Command's Effect instead when
     * construction is cheap and stateless (an HTTP client via `foldkit/http`
     * is a thin `fetch` wrapper), when different Commands want different
     * implementations of the same tag (`KeyValueStore` over localStorage in
     * one Command and sessionStorage in another), or when a service that can
     * fail to construct should only take down the Commands that use it. An
     * HTTP client can graduate here once many Commands share one configured
     * client, but it starts per-Command.
